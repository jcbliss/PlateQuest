Spot the States. Complete the Quest.

## How It Works

### 1. Profiles

- Delete or switch between profiles as needed.

### 2. Trips

- Create, name, and manage your trips independently.

### 3. State Grid
- Tap each state to mark it as spotted (turns green).
- Automatically saves for each profile/trip.
